# MLalzheimersDetection

This project implements a machine learning model that analyzes brain MRI images to identify different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. It explores patterns within the images, visualizes class distributions, and evaluates model performance to support early detection. 

Developed in Python, and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and evaluation are used.
